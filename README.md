Real-Time Object Detection System for Smart Waste Management

This project implements a real-time waste classification system using cutting-edge object detection models, YOLOv9 and YOLOv10. It identifies and classifies common waste typesâ€”plastic, metal, paper, and organicâ€”from live video streams. Designed as part of my MSc Artificial Intelligence coursework at the National College of Ireland, the project explores both performance and reliability of deep learning models in real-world, variable conditions.
